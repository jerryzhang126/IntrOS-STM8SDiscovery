IntrOS
---------
Free, simple and tiny cooperative operating system (OS) designed for deeply embedded applications.
Target: ARM Cortex-M, STM8, AVR8 families.
It was inspired by the concept of a state machine.
Procedure executed by the task (task state) doesn't have to be noreturn-type.
It will be executed into an infinite loop.
There's a dedicated function for immediate change the task state.
---------
Features:
- kernel works in cooperative mode only
- kernel can operate in tick-less mode (32-bit timer required)
- signals (clear, protect)
- events
- flags (any, all)
- barriers
- semaphores
- mutexes
- condition variables
- message queues
- mailbox queues
- timers (one-shot, periodic)
- all documentation is contained within the source files
